# Climate Analysis and Exploration
## Overview
This project involves the analysis and exploration of climate data from a database. It is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
This section focuses on conducting detailed analyses and exploring various aspects of the climate data.

### Precipitation Analysis
Retrieve and analyze precipitation data for the last 12 months.

### Station Analysis
Explore information about weather stations.

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
In this part, a web application is designed to provide access to climate data via API endpoints.

### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
